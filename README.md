This is a collection of projects I've done in the past that I felt were worthy of display. The Robot Factory game includes a .jar file for an easy way to try out my implementation of the game. I have a local build of my team's version of the MagPie CMS ready for display via XAMPP. The Trivia Maze was a 3 man project that has a .sln you can run to test out our implementation of an EWU themed trivia maze.
