This is a collection of projects I've done in the past that I felt were worthy of display. The Robot Factory game includes a .jar file for an easy way to try out my implementation of the game. I have a local build of my team's version of the MagPie CMS ready for display via XAMPP. My role in the development of the MagPie CMS was primarily backend work, setting up API endpoints and utilizing external libraries to accomplish tasks such as QR Code reading and file compression. The Trivia Maze was a 3 man project that has a .sln you can run to test out our implementation of an EWU themed trivia maze. For this project I worked on the forms and questions prompts while helping with the design of the game board.
