This is a collection of projects I've done in the past that I felt were worthy of display. The Software Engineering project is limited to just the World Loader Parser due to loss of access to the other two parsers. The Robot Factory game includes a .jar file for an easy way to try out my implementation of the game. I have a local version of my team's version of the MagPie CMS ready for show via XAMPP. The Trivia Maze was a 3 man project that has a .sln you can run to test out our implementation of an EWU themed trivia maze.
