This is a collection of projects I've done in the past that I felt were worthy of display. The Software Engineering project is limited to just the World Loader Parser due to loss of access to the other two parsers. The Robot Factory game includes a .jar file for an easy way to try out my implementation of the game. Also, there is a live version of the Magpie CMS running at www.magpiehunt.com.
