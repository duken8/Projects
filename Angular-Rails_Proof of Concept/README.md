# README

This project is to attempt to establish communication between a frontend angular application manged by the webpacker gem and backend rails server data.

Currently a work in progress as using the latest versions of angular, webpack, and rails caused issues when following older tutorials and educational information online.

It appears even minor updates can cause deprecation issues with both webpack and angular versions.
